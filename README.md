Title: Effects of Source Trustworthiness on Online Discussions


Abstract: Research indicates that misinformation elicits strong negative sentiments, thereby boosting its traction and engagement on social media, however, it is unclear whether the observed dynamics are unique to misinformation, or if we are in fact measuring common causes like political orientation or emotions in the stimuli. Here, we study 9M German Twitter (now X) discussions from the timeframe October 2020 to March 2022 that follow a post mentioning sources with varying trustworthiness levels. Using the whole spectrum of news source trustworthiness and approximating causal inference with a nonparametric matching approach, first results show evidence for the limited effects of misinformation on social media.
